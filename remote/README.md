# SSR Hydration Rspack Vue Remote

## Setup

To get started, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

Run the following command to build the remote application and start the Node.js server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will generate the `mf-manifest.json` and `remoteEntry.js` files, and serve the fully SSR-hydrated Rspack remote application.
